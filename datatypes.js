/* EXERCISE 1
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 2
 Try to describe what a variable is, in your own words.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/
/*
let a = 12
let b = 20

// Add two numbers
let sum = a + b

// Display Sum
console.log("The sum of a and b is: sum ")
console.log(a)
console.log(b)
console.log(sum)
*/


/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/

/*
var x
var x = 12
console.log(x)
*/



/* EXERCISE 5
 Create a variable called name and assign to it the string "John Doe".
*/

/*
var name
var name = "John Doe"

console.log(name)
*/


/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/

/*
let y = 12
console.log(y)

//Substract two  numbers
let difference = y - x

//Display Result
console.log("The difference of y and x is: difference")
console.log(difference)
*/


/* EXERCISE 7
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/


var name1 = "john"
var name2 = "John"

console.log("\n -------Equality------")
console.log("Is john equal to John", name1.toLowerCase() === name2.toLowerCase() )




/* EXERCISE 8
 Create a variable named x, and assign to it a numeric value less than 10.
 Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1, it should print "one", if x is 5 it should print "five" etc.).
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 9
 [Extra] Assign a value to a variable using a ternary operator (this topic has not been covered during lesson yet,
 try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together!)
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
 Upload the .js file on Eduflow before 5PM CET. In the next days we'll also learn how to use GIT!
